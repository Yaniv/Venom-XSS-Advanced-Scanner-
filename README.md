Venom Advanced XSS Scanner (Version 5.49)

Venom Advanced XSS Scanner is a Python-based tool designed for ethical penetration testers and security researchers to detect Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications. Version 5.49 (April 2025) introduces LLM Prompt-Wiz for AI-driven payload generation, extended event handlers, sandbox and HTML sanitizer bypasses, enhanced subdomain scanning, and robust anonymity features, making it a cutting-edge tool for web security testing.

Key Features





LLM Prompt-Wiz: Leverages AI platforms (e.g., xAI Grok, OpenAI GPT-4) for dynamic payload generation and vulnerability analysis.



Extended Event Handlers: Tests advanced event handlers (e.g., onmouseover, onpointerrawupdate, onclick) for HTML contexts.



Sandbox & Sanitizer Bypasses: Includes payloads to evade browser sandboxes (e.g., iframe, meta refresh) and HTML sanitizers (e.g., DOMPurify, server-side filters).



Comprehensive Payloads: Sources over 8,000 payloads from /usr/local/bin/payloads/, custom files, or AI-generated sets.



WAF/IPS Detection & Bypass: Detects Web Application Firewalls (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS WAF) with adaptive 403 bypass techniques.



Subdomain Scanning: Tests HTTP/HTTPS subdomains, considering 200 and 403 status codes as live.



Anonymity Support: Routes traffic through Tor or custom proxies with IP anonymization and SSL verification options.



Parallel Testing: Supports up to 20 threads with adaptive throttling and stealth mode for low-profile scans.



Real-Time Feedback: Displays live scan progress and generates detailed reports in JSON/CSV formats.
